## Project idea
I have grown several succulent plants. They don't need to be watered very frequenty so sometimes I forgot to water them. I want to design something that can tell me when the plant is dry so I can water the plant with a proper amount of water when it needs. The idea is to put some sensors in the soil to sense the dryness, and send this information to a micro-controller. When the dryness reach some level, the micro-controller will send a message to my smart phone or other electronic devices to remind me to water the plants.
